for level07 we find a binary. when run it outputs 'level07'.
With nm we can deduct it calls getenv  and system, with gdb that it creates a srtring with asprintf and then calls system. (eve  easier to find with radare2 but we shall not using for this assignement)

lookinf at an hexdump we can see it call the env variable LOGNAME and put in in the following formated string 
"./bin/echo %s" 

we have to put the payload in $LOGNAME

export LOGNAME=`getflag` gives us an error.

we use ';' to terminate the first command call and do a second one.

export LOGNAME=;getflag
./level07

it gives us the flag
