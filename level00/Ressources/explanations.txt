We see that it's impossible to do almost anything.

We look for the file that our user or flag00 can manipulate :

find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null

gives /user/sbin/john

cat  /user/sbin/john
cdiiddwpgswtgt

it's not possible to su flag00 with this. 
We try to decypher it with a caesar code and a 15 shift:

nottoohardhere

ithe token is x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
