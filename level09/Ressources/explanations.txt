at /home/user/level09 we see a binary and a file called token

we test the binary, it requires an argument

we test with ./level09 aaaa and outputs abcd.

It add the value of the index for each value.

cat token gives us jibberish. We try to use the binary on it but still jibberish.

We write a programm (turner.c) that does the opposite (substract the value of the index).

we get a flag to connect to flag09.
