We find an executable and a token that we cannot open

The usage of the program tells us it sends a file to a host if we have access to it

we check the program with the nm function and whith the help of the hint in the usage we look how
to exploit the acess function.

trying to sends some file we see that the port is 6969

The exploit is a race condition.

We aim to create a file that we have access to, it will be accepted by the program but before it is sent
we change it by a symbolic link aiming to the token.

We create two scripts : linking.sh and running.sh to do those action

we listen on port 6969 thanks to netcat and send it to a file

nc -lk 6969 > listener   (-l localhost , k keep listening)

we find the token to su flag10 with cat listener
