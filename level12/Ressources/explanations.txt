/home/user/level12 we find a a perl script (see level12.pl)
on port 4646 it accepts a GET request with two params : x and y.

two regex are applied to x:
	- transform every lowercase into uppercase
	- delete everything after a space char

then a command egrep is called, me must find a way to inject our own getflag command while
avoiding the regex.

We aim to make the egrep command to execute a script because of the space destruction

we name our script EXPLOIT in /tmp because linux is case sensitive

we do : chmod 777 /tmp/EXPLOIT so it can be execute by everyuser on the machine.

Then we open a browser to make our request, we used a external browser.

the request is : {vm_Adress}:4646/x=`/*/EXPLOIT` 

we use `` to make it executable and globbing (*) to avoid the regex uppercasing everything

we find the flag doing

cat /tmp/flag
