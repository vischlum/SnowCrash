We find that /etc/passwd contains something for flag01

flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash

we know that this is is a hashed password,

we use john the ripper to crack the password 

we create a file called hashes.txt containing flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw

ans then 

sudo john hashes.txt we we get the following output :

Proceeding with wordlist:/usr/share/john/password.lst, rules:Wordlist
abcdefg          (flg01)
