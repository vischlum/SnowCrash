at /home/user/level13 we find a executable that asks to be run with a uid 4242

with nm we find that it uses the getuid.

we run it with gdb,

it compares the return (in eax) of getuid to 0x1092 (4242)
we change the value of eax after the call so it will jump to the good set of instructions

gdb ./level13
b main
run
nexti (until main +14)
set $eax=0x1092
continue

it gives us a token connecting us to level14
