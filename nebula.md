This ISO is part of the 42 School cursus (where it was added by Wielfried André).  
It is *heavily inspired* by the Nebula ISO (currently hosted on [exploit.education](https://exploit.education/nebula/), previously on [exploit-exercises.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20111201224246/http://exploit-exercises.com/nebula))

Here's a correspondence table between Snowcrash and Nebula exercises:
