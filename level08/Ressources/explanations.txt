at /home/user/level08 we find a file named token and an executable

we see that it takes an argument. it refuses to read file with "token" in their name.

It is confirmed by a disassembly with gdb : it is protected by strstr.

We need to find a way to spoof the name.

We create a symbolic link in /tmp

ln -s  /home/user/level08/token /tmp/spoof  (beware to use a absolute path)

./level08 /tmp/spoof

it gives a token we use to connect to user flag08
