We cannot find anything related to level14, file or process ...

Our only solution is to exploit getflag.

We run it with gdb :

we set a breakpoint at main to explore the asm code

set disassembly-flavor intel
b main

we find the call to ptrace which will be triggered by gdb.
we change eax to avoid it :

b *0x0804898e
set $eax=0

we jump to the call to getuid, we find in /etc/passwd that flag14 uid is 3004

b *0x08048c01
set $eax=3004
c

we get the flag !
